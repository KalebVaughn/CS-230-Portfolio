# CS-230-Portfolio
The Gaming Room has developed a game application for andriod devices where teams of user's have to guess drawings within a certain amount of time, and if they dont guess correctly, the opposing team can steal within 15 seconds. They want this web-based game to be playable and used on all platforms.
I think I did well in understanding what the client wanted and needed for the application, also breaking the development requirements down, explianing the design constraints, describing the domain model, and just the overall requirements for developing this web-based application. 
I found the UML diagram for The Gaming Room to be extrememly helpful, because it gave me an idea of what the client was looking for when it came to developing the application. So yes the process of going through a design document is very beneficial when developing code.
One thing I would choose to revise on the design document would be the evaluation, I feel I could've used better examples for the client and server side when it came to the mobile devices. 
It is very important to implement the user's needs because it leads to a better user experience. I interpretted the user's needs by making sure the user requirements are all met, and I have to also make sure the game can be accessed on all platforms where multiple users can be on the web-based application at the same time.
My approach when developing software is to take each requirement one step at a time, because when trying to complete multiple objectives at once it can effect the code and involve multiple errors. So with the idea of focusing on one tasks at a time can be very beneficial. 




THIS IS NOT THE CORRECT PORTFOLIO FOR CS 255.
